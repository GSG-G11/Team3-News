            <p class="p-news">In the team news announcement posted by PSG in the lead-up to the match, the No.10 was assigned to Messi. The Argentine currently wears the No.30 shirt for PSG, due to Neymar occupying the No.10. Usually, of course, players are allowed to
                wear numbers higher than the number 11. Neymar will not be featuring in the game against Nice as he is currently recovering from a left ankle sprain with ligament damage sustained in a Ligue 1 match against Saint-Etienne back in November.</p>
